### Hullo 🫠
I am Adhvaith, a 17 year old self taught 👨‍💻developer. I like coding and in my free time I love solving 🧊 rubiks cubes.
Since 2018 , I have been trying to develop a full fledged integrated development environment using nodejs , this mostly comes from my idea that the future of coding won't happen on your machines but would happen in the ☁️ cloud/ 🌐 web with developers in a continuous symbiosis with 🧠AI ( sort of like Eddiebrock and 🕷️venom).
I am also a huge fan of 🤖 robotics and I have participated in many robotics competions across India , developing stuff using arduino and raspberry pi's (eventually piquing my intrest in coding ).
- 🛟 I have worked on making a git server just like github - https://github.com/adhvaithprasad/git-server
- 💽 I have made a full fledged JSON database called [xenialdb](https://github.com/adhvaithprasad/xenial-database)  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/xenialdb
- 💬 I have also made a chat application - https://github.com/adhvaithprasad/chat-for-firestudio
